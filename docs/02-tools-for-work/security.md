# Password security

Passwords are the front line of protection for user accounts and an important aspect of computer security. To avoid compromising your work information — and possibly Bloom Works' entire corporate network — use the guidelines below to select and secure your passwords. All Bloom Works employees (including contractors and vendors with access to BW systems) are responsible for taking these steps.

### Password recommendations 

- Avoid repeating passwords for multiple websites.
- Passwords should be at least 8-15 characters in length. The longer, the better. 
- Use a mix of digits and punctuation characters (e.g., 0-9 and !@#$%^&*).
- Avoid using common words or phrases (e.g., "password" or "hello").
- **NEVER** base your password on personal information, names of family members, etc. 
  

Don't share your passwords with anyone. If you need to make an exception, be sure to reset your password ASAP. 

Treat your passwords as sensitive, confidential information. If someone requests your password(s), please let them know that you can't provide that information per Bloom Works policy. If you suspect an account or password has been compromised, report the incident immediately to Sofia and change all related passwords.

We recommend the use of a password manager program to help ensure that all passwords are strong, unique, and easy to change. 

Don't write down your passwords or store them on your web browser. Try to create passwords that can be easily remembered. One way to do this is to create a password based on a song title, affirmation, or other phrase. For example, the phrase might be "This may be one way to remember," and the password could be "TmB1w2R!" or "Tmb1W>r~" or some other variation.

### 2 factor authorization (2FA)

If you're given the option to opt into 2FA, please do so.
