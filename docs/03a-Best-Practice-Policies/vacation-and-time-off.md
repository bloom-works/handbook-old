# Time off policies and practices

We all need a break sometimes. We believe in taking the time you need for yourselves and your families.

## Salaried employees

### How much time off do you get?

Employees who work 33+ hours per week are considered **full time**. They accrue:

- 120 hours of vacation each calendar year
- 80 hours (10 days) of sick leave each calendar year
- 64 hours (8 days) of floating holiday time to be used at the employee's discretion
- Up to 40 hours of unused vacation can be carried over per calendar year. These unused, accrued vacation days DO NOT aggregate year-on-year.

**Part-time** salaried employees who work 32 or fewer hours per week will accrue a prorated amount of vacation and floating holiday time.

- Part-time employees are still entitled to 80 hours (10 days) of sick time.
- The unused carryover rate of unused PTO and sick time will be determined upon hire, depending on the number of expected work hours.

Sick time and floating holidays **do not** carry over from year to year. All unused sick time and floating holidays are forfeited on Dec 31.

The office is also closed from Christmas Day (Dec 25) through New Years (Jan 1 or whatever day New Years is observed as a federal holiday in the U.S.). This doesn't require use of floating holidays.

### Employee departures & pay outs

- Unused, accrued vacation time is paid out upon departure.
- Unused floating holidays and sick time **are not** paid out when you leave Bloom.

## Requesting time off

**Whenever possible, please give your manager and project lead at least 2 weeks advance notice of planned time off. This helps us keep projects running smoothly.**

When you take time off:

1. Talk to your project lead (this may be a PM or an EM) and manager
2. Request the time in Gusto (U.S. employees only)
3. Mark any full days off in the Bloom Calendar (create a full-day or multi-day event with the title "[NAME - OOO]")
4. Mark time off on your own calendar as an OOO block.

All of this only applies for time off over half a day. For less than half a day, work with your manager to decide if you need to request it in Gusto (you may be able to simply shift your work hours a bit), and just mark it on your own calendar.

## Personal leaves of absence

Employees of Bloom Works, including part-time employees, who have worked for at least one year may request a personal leave of absence. A leave of absence is for extended periods, typically four weeks or more, where an employee is fully or part-time away from work, for example taking courses/training, handling extended personal matters, completing a personal project, or world travel. Leaves will be discussed on a case by case basis and may be paid, partially paid or unpaid.

## Parental leave

Welcoming a new child is an amazing time for a family and we want to support employees during this time to take the time to bond with their new child (by birth or adoption, or placement in foster care if the child is under the age of 18, or incapable of self-care because of a physical or mental disability) and acclimate to the new life ahead. Our policy is that expectant parents can take eight weeks of leave fully paid after 9 months of employment. If an employee has been at the company for less than 9 months or if for any reason the expectant parent needs additional leave, we will review requests on a case-by-case basis. All Parental Leave described in this Policy shall be available for a 12-month period following the birth or adoption of a child.

For birthing parents there is also the option to use short-term disability for additional paid leave time. Please contact HR for more information on this benefit. 

## Documentation, misuse, and legal stuff

Bloom Works reserves the right to require documentation verifying an employee's need for time off if it is more than 3 days _or_ there are indications of a pattern of abuse, such as repeated use of unscheduled time off adjacent to weekends, holidays, or pay day. If we ask for documentation from your doctor, we do not need to know diagnoses, and do not need your medical details.

### Time off and other approved leave

Time off pursuant to this policy is not intended for long-term leave or as a long-term care solution. As such, exempt employees on leaves of absences for more than thirty days, including otherwise unpaid leaves of absences, will not be eligible for paid time off beyond the first thirty days. Bloom Works will require non-exempt employees to exhaust accrued, unused PTO concurrently with extended leaves of absences, including under the Family and Medical Leave Act or comparable state laws, if applicable.

Employees who are eligible for any other paid leave under Bloom Works policies will not receive paid time off under this policy while on such paid leave (for example, parental leave) in addition to other paid leave. Likewise, time off and any other paid leaves shall run concurrently such that the duration of any leave shall not extend beyond the longer of the available leave. For instance, an employee may be eligible for eight weeks of paid parental leave under Bloom Works' policy, but will not be eligible for additional time off after such leave.

Similarly, employees who are eligible for wage replacement benefits while on an approved leave (for example, an employee who is eligible for workers' compensation, short-term disability, or long-term disability) will not receive paid time off compensation except as provided below.

If an employee remains absent for seven or more calendar days due to his or her own illness or injury, the employee must apply for short-term disability benefits through the state-provided plan or, if applicable, a company-provided plan, by contacting HR to initiate a disability claim. Absences covered by short-term disability, including pregnancy-related disabilities, are not eligible for paid time off under this policy. If the company becomes aware that an absence may qualify for short-term disability benefits, management or the People Ops Team will direct the employee to contact Guardian to apply for short-term disability benefits.

For information or questions concerning this policy and the use of time off during otherwise unpaid leaves of absence or short-term disability the employee should contact HR for assistance.

### Abuse of time off

Abuse of time off, including as legally-mandated paid sick leave, may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. Disciplinary action may be taken if a pattern of potential abuse of time off develops, if an employee is failing to attain necessary goals for his or her position, or if an excessive number of absences occur that are beyond the scope of any approved FMLA leave, approved disability leave, or leave provided as a reasonable accommodation.

### State and local paid sick leave laws

To the extent state or local laws mandate paid sick leave, this policy is intended to ensure that eligible employees who work in those jurisdictions accrue and receive paid sick leave in accordance with those requirements. Bloom Works prohibits discrimination or retaliation against employees because of a request for time off for legally-protected paid sick leave purposes, or use of such time off. If you believe that you have been treated unfairly on account of your use of such time off, or request for such time off, please immediately report this concern to HR so that the matter may be reviewed and appropriate corrective action may be taken.

## Contractors

- Please manage your schedule and take the time you need. Communicate with your project lead and Engagement Manager to ensure they're aware of your working hours and time off, and can communicate those to clients as-needed.
- Marking out-of-office time on your Bloom calendar helps your team know when you're available.
