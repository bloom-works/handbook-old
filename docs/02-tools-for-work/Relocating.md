# Relocating
We understand that life happens and sometimes you may need to relocate. We ask that — whenever possible — you give us at least 6 weeks notice of a planned move. This notice will give us the time we need to complete any required local and state tax registrations so that taxes are computed correctly. It also helps us avoid issues with trying to do payroll and insurance gymnastics if we don’t get all of the required registrations done in time.

We also need to make sure it won’t cause issues with your client and/or team. This is unlikely, but it’s important that we check.

## Temporary relocation
If you plan to work away from your primary work location where there’s a significant difference in timezone or you’re out of the country, please give as much advance notice as possible. Similar to above, we may need to make sure that it won’t be an issue with your particular contract, client, or team. As a specific example, some clients have policies against accessing systems from outside of the country.

In general, we try to be as flexible and accommodating as possible and will work with you to find the best plan for everyone.
