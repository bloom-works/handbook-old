# Welcome to the team!

As a Bloomer, it might be helpful to have some background on Bloom Works — how it all started, what we're trying to do here, and some of our core values.

## How it all began

Once upon a time in 2018, after creating the digital services team for the City of Boston, Lauren started Bloom Works (originally Gov Bloom, which may still pop up) to take what she learned to more agencies. She put together a dream team of seasoned (and brilliant!) designers, researchers, content strategists, and developers who have led the redesigns of websites like VA.gov and health.gov.

Many of us have experience working in the government, and we know firsthand the challenges of modernizing services. We've worked with legacy systems and bureaucratic teams that made it nearly impossible to put even a simple form online — or to bring real modern change to the workplace. In that world, when we tried to hire outside help, we found people who were more interested in keeping us locked into their contracts than in solving our problems.

At Bloom, we've made it our business to be different. We're here to help navigate complex paths to make lives easier and visions more achievable. We’re inspired by the important work our partners (not clients) are doing, and our mission is to help them build cleaner solutions to digital challenges.

## Our core values

*This is the most recent iteration that we updated as a team in December 2021.

### At Bloom Works, we: 
- **Lead with courage:** Welcome ambiguity. Remember that challenging the status quo requires stepping into uncharted territory. 
- **Center the people:** Seek an understanding of people's lived experiences, and challenge systems that perpetuate inequities. 
- **Share the process:** Cultivate mutual trust between peers, partners, and clients. Leave egos behind, and share findings.  
- **Adapt to change:** Pursue excellence by being curious, determined, and willing to change plans. Make only new mistakes. 
- **Design for impact:** Come with high expectations but be cognizant of constraints. Create processes that people can actually use and build on over time.
