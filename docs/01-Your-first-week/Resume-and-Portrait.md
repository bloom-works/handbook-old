# Bloom Works resume and portrait instructions

Now that you're part of the team, we want to add you to the Bloom website!

## How to get your photo on the Bloom Works "Team" page:

* [Check out the bios on our website](https://bloomworks.digital/team) to get a general feel for what we’re serving up already.
* If you have an image that's similar in layout and vibe, [email it to Adam](mailto:adam@bloomworks.digital) or send it to him on Slack. 
* If you need to take a new photo, try to get in some natural light and position the camera further away than selfie range.
 
If you have questions, reach out to Adam on Slack or on email.
 
## Team resume instructions

We often submit team members' resumes in our proposals, so we have a Bloom template for consistency. 

* [Check out the resume template on GDrive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IS46KYx0JhVQKmTGxg8M_wS6nJSkADg35j3DynwWw5Y/edit?usp=sharing)
* Create a copy and move it to the [Bloom Full Team Drive > Team > Bios, photos, resumes folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1wqWI38uNF0l8XbqhPGGLFDN-m26A4s60).
* Once you've finished editing, share it with Sofia. She'll follow up with you about any questions or clarifications. 
 
Aaaaand that’s it. Just a few simple steps and you too can be a staple of the Bloom Works Team Page! Huzzah and hooray!
