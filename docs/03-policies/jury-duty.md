## Objective

To provide income protection while an employee carries out his or her civic responsibility, Bloom Works provides the difference between jury duty pay and an employee’s regular day’s pay for time spent serving on jury duty. Generally, income protection for time spent serving on jury duty will be provided for a maximum of five workdays. Additional income-protected time away from the workplace for this purpose will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

## Eligibility

Full-time and regular, part-time employees are eligible to receive this benefit.

## Responsibility

Upon receipt of notification from the state or federal courts of an obligation to serve on a jury or to act as a court witness, the employee should notify his or her supervisor. The employee is required to provide copies of the subpoena or jury summons to his or her supervisor and to the payroll department.

The supervisor will verify the notification by contacting the office issuing the summons or subpoena and make scheduling adjustments to accommodate the employee’s obligation. The supervisor will also provide court documentation to payroll for processing.

Employees appearing in their own case as a plaintiff or defendant or for a nonsubpoenaed court appearance will not receive paid time off. Vacation or unpaid time should be used for such instances.
