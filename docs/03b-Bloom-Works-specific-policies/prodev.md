# Professional development (prodev)

## Introduction

Bloom recognizes the importance of professional development opportunities for all team members, and we encourage you to take advantage of this Bloom benefit. We value Professional Development for a number of reasons:

- It's a win-win. Professional development grows the depth and value of the company offerings and enhances your career opportunities, too.
- Professional development provides career mobility for each person - increasing our feeling of safety, which leads to:
  - Having the courage to fail, which leads to experimentation, innovation, and learning
  - Having the courage to challenge the status quo, which leads to organizational learning
  - Having the courage to be vulnerable, which leads to authentic communications and connection
  - Open-minded thinking, which leads to increased tolerance of others' ideas and personality styles

Bloom Works supports and encourages the Professional Development (prodev) of each team member by providing an annual budget of $2,000 per person to be used for prodev-related expenses. Note: If you are a part-time employee or under 30 hours/week, your budget will be prorated based on your working hours.

In addition to the annual budget, each team member is encouraged to use a "take what you need" approach to using time for prodev pursuits during business hours, within the bounds of any billable hours goals you may have. If you need guidance on what amount of time is appropriate to spend on prodev in a given year, consult with your manager.

## Your Prodev Budget

Each full-time team member is provided an annual prodev budget of $2,000. If you're just starting, you'll need to wait 90 days before you gain access to your prodev budget. If you're a part-time employee or under 32 hours/week, your budget will be prorated based on your working hours.

This budget can be used a number of things:

- Online or in-person courses
- Testing fees & renewal costs associated with professional certifications
- Other costs incurred from you becoming a smarter, more awesomer version of you

There are some limitations on the prodev budget usage. For spending amounts over $50, you'll need to get approval in advance. And unfortunately under the benefit plan we've chosen for this program we are not able to directly reimburse things like travel costs or for supplies that you can retain after completing your courses/tests/certifications. If you have specific questions about limitations reach out to [HR](mailto:sofia@bloomworks.digital).

For ProDev expenses we ask that you put together a justification or explanation as to why this expense is relevant to your role and development. A paragraph or two should be more than enough to address this. When you're ready to move forward please email the request and explanation to [admin@bloomworks.digital.](mailto:admin@bloomworks.digital)

Remember that your budget does NOT carry over at the end of the year. So get busy learning something! Use it or lose it.

Want to spend more money than I have budget for? Talk to your manager if you have prodev needs that can't be covered by your annual budget.

## Making a Plan

While this isn't a required practice, you are still encouraged to take responsibility for your own professional development by creating a prodev plan and setting goals for yourself.
This also helps in getting your ProDev expenses approved in a timely manner. 

## Asking a Mentor, Coach, or Peer to Help

For some people, getting input from others is an important part of the professional development process. You are encouraged to seek out other Bloomers who you think could help you achieve your prodev goals. This may be a manager, a peer, or any person who is good at something you'd like to learn. You may even wish to seek expertise outside of Bloom Works to help.

If you're asked by someone else to assist with their prodev, please make time to help them out!

## Examples
- Attend an industry conference, like [Code for America](https://summit.codeforamerica.org/)
- Take a course at your local university or online institution
- Get a membership to an organization related to your discipline (ex. Sofia is a member of the Society for HR Managers)
