# General business expenses
Bloom Works will timely reimburse pre-approved, business-related out-of-pocket expenses as long as you submit a receipt. 
Receipts MUST show the card used (last 4 digits) and a date in order to be accepted.^ 

*Before incurring any expense* please estimate the cost and get approval from the budget owner. The ONLY exception to this being professional development expenses of less than $50, which don't require pre-approval. 

## Process
Once you have estimated the total cost of the expense(s), message the budget owner to request approval. In most cases, the budget owner will be the project lead. Be sure to include any necessary details, including why the expense is necessary or recommended.  
 
 Once you've made the pre-approved purchase, log on to **Harvest > Expenses** and fill in the following fields:
 
 - **Date**: Use the date reflected on the receipt.

 - **Project**: If it's a client project, be sure to select that here and mark as unbillable. Bloom has a separate category for professional development-related expenses, which you can read about in the [professional development section of this handbook](https://bloom-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/03-policies/prodev/). 
 
 - **Category**: Select the best fit from the dropdown.


 - **Receipt**: Include the actual paper receipt AND an image showing the budget owner's approval of the expense.
 
 *Pro Tip - dowload the Harvest app to track your expenses while on-the-go* 
 
 If you don't see your project code or an appropriate category code, contact HR. 

^In some cases you can provide a bank statement as a substitude for actual receipts. These exceptions are considered on a case-by-case basis by HR or Ops.
