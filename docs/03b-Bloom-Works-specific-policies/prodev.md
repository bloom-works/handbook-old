# Professional development (prodev)

## Introduction

Bloom recognizes the importance of professional development opportunities for all team members, and we encourage you to take advantage of this Bloom benefit. We value Professional Development for a number of reasons:

- It's a win-win. Professional development grows the depth and value of the company offerings and enhances your career opportunities, too.
- Professional development provides career mobility for each person - increasing our feeling of safety, which leads to:
  - Having the courage to fail, which leads to experimentation, innovation, and learning
  - Having the courage to challenge the status quo, which leads to organizational learning
  - Having the courage to be vulnerable, which leads to authentic communications and connection
  - Open-minded thinking, which leads to increased tolerance of others' ideas and personality styles

Bloom Works supports and encourages the Professional Development (prodev) of each team member by providing an annual budget of $2,000 per person to be used for prodev-related expenses. Note: If you are a part-time employee or under 30 hours/week, your budget will be prorated based on your working hours.

In addition to the annual budget, each team member is encouraged to use a "take what you need" approach to using time for prodev pursuits during business hours, within the bounds of any billable hours goals you may have. If you need guidance on what amount of time is appropriate to spend on prodev in a given year, consult with your manager.

## Your prodev budget

Each full-time team member is provided an annual prodev budget of $2,000. If you're just starting, you'll need to wait 90 days before you gain access to your prodev budget. If you're a part-time employee or under 32 hours/week, your budget will be prorated based on your working hours.

This budget can be used a number of things but there are some limitations on the prodev budget usage, we'll go into more detail on that later.

For ProDev expenses >$50 we ask that you put together a justification or explanation as to why this expense is relevant to your role and development. A paragraph or two should be more than enough to address this. When you're ready to move forward please sit down with your direct Manager to discuss the request. 

Remember that your budget does NOT carry over at the end of the year. So get busy learning something! Use it or lose it.

Want to spend more money than I have budget for? Talk to your manager if you have prodev needs that can't be covered by your annual budget.

## Making a plan

While this isn't a required practice, you are still encouraged to take responsibility for your own professional development by creating a prodev plan and setting goals for yourself.
This also helps in getting your ProDev expenses approved in a timely manner. 

## Asking a Mentor, Coach, or Peer to help

For some people, getting input from others is an important part of the professional development process. You are encouraged to seek out other Bloomers who you think could help you achieve your prodev goals. This may be a manager, a peer, or any person who is good at something you'd like to learn. You may even wish to seek expertise outside of Bloom Works to help.

If you're asked by someone else to assist with their prodev, please make time to help them out!

## Types of ProDev expenses we'd expect to see

### Memberships, conferences, dues and subscriptions

Fees for individual members in business associations, as well as fees for magaine, newspaper, or newsletter subscriptions, may be allowable. Your Manager will decide whether these costs will be covered. Individual membership in professional associations or other costs incurred to maintain professional certifications or licenses that are directly related to the employee's current position and have a clear business benefit to Bloom Works are allowable. 

The cost of membership in athletic clubs, social clubs, fraternal orders, buying clubs, or other similar organizations generally do not qualify. You will need to pay for these memberships personally, unless there is a clear business benefit and the primary purpose of the membership is to benefit Bloom. 


### Approved degree programs / coursework

Approved degree programs and coursework are defined as: Certificate, Associates, Bachelors and Masters degree programs. 

Reimbursement will be provided for any required or elective course that is directly related to your work; or that leads to a business-related or job-related degree. Within this context, Bloom reserves the exclusive right to decide whether a degree program or course is business- or job-related.

In order to be reimbursed, you MUST earn a minimum passing grade of better. For the purposes of this policy, a passing grade is defined as an "A," "B," or "C" for undergraduate classes, and at least a "B" for graduate classes. If the course is a "Pass/Fail," a "Pass" is acceptable. 

Bloom will not provide any reimbursement if you withdraw from an approved course or if the approved course is canceled. Furthermore, you must promptly inform your Manager if you withdraw from an approved course or if the course is canceled.

If you receive an incomplete in a course, you will have until the end of the following semester to remedy the matter by meeting any and all requirements. Failure to do so will preclude you from participating in the tuition reimbursement plan and you must repay the company for any advance payments received.

### Travel costs to- and from- in-person events

Travel costs and fees 

### Materials such as books, journals, software, etc. 

As long as the material is directly related to your current duties and/or an approved career development plan then you may apply for reimbursement.
