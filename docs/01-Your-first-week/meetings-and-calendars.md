# Repeat Meetings
Here at Bloom, we're all about asking 'does this need to be a meeting or can we get what we need from an asynchronous conversation?' There are always going to be those times where sitting together on Zoom provides the best environment for productivity. 
With that in mind we have a few different kinds of meetings that happen regularly. 

## Internal Bloom meetings
* Culture and Values - this meeting is optional for all attendees and happens every other week. We rely on the 'culture-and-values' slack channel to ideate and track topic ideas. 
* Bloomtime - a once-monthly meeting where we share BD and operational updates
* Project sharebacks - TBD
* 1:1s - when you first join the team your manager will set up check ins on a weekly basis. As you settle in these meetings may drop in frequency
* Quarterly All Hands - following the 2021 team offsite leadership has committed to meeting with the team on a quarterly basis to provide detailed information on the health, status and growth of the company
* 360 reviews - these happen every 6 months and you'll sometimes hear them referred to as 'Retrospectives.' [Check out this page for more info](https://bloom-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/03-policies/360-reviews/)

## Project related meetings
* Your product manager will set these up, but generally speaking they will usually host a daily 'Stand Up' so the project team can gather and discuss updates, deadlines, etc. 

# Shared Calendars
Right now we're keeping things pretty simple:
* **Bloom-Calendar** is where we document team member's Out of Office / vacation time, operations deadlines of importance, and general info that needs to be shared with the whole team
* **Bloom-BD** is where we track proposal timelines, BD-related events, etc. 

# General Calendar etiquette
*Make sure to set your Google Calendar to the correct timezon and enter in your regular office hours.*

Whether you're a maker mind or manager mind [you'll hear this article referenced a lot in our office](https://medium.com/coaching-notes/maker-mind-vs-manager-mind-f4e01d294d34) - your team members rely on your calendar remaining accurate and up-to-date.

## Some general tips we've learned based on shared experience:
* If you need uninterrupted work time, block it off on your calendar
* Adjust your timezone if you're traveling-while-working
* Add a 10 minute buffer to the end of your meeting so your attendees have time to individually 'debrief' before they jump into their next task
* When in doubt, before you schedule a meeting, ASK your fellow team member if the timing works for them 
* Document your personal appointments! Life happens so if you know you need to take an hour to pick up your kid from day care, put it on your cal so we know not to bother you
* Full day or multi-day out of office time should always be on YOUR calendar and the BLOOM calendar
