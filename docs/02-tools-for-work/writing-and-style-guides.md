# Writing style

## The Bloom Works 'voice' is always evolving

Our guiding principle is to write clear, useful, and usable content â€” whether it's a proposal, email, or web page. To learn some of our tricks and tips, [please review our writing style guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1YSRuu0traltiKHJ1drc8xT4EWeZfqjX_KSN2RK0Pc/edit?usp=sharing).

If you'd like to suggest any changes or additions, add comments directly to the document or chat up one of our friendly content strategists. 

# Visual style

Another great reference document is our [Visual Style Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k5lB6L2Uaiaomw6QZqqNWdDUad_IDbMEEEceI9Cd0Gg/edit#heading=h.g5pyyoerqoo3), especially if you'll be creating any business development or client-facing Bloom Works documents.

**Pro tip: open up the visual style guide, then click on the 'style' drop down, and set your default styles.** It'll set your Google docs to default to Bloom document styles (font sizes, colors, line spacing, etc.)

The screenshot below shows you exactly how to turn on this default:
