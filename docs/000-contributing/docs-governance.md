# Documentation Governance

Every team member with a GitHub account is empowered to make [pull requests](git-workflow.md) to change any part of the documentation, and every team member is encourage to review any pull request.

Ideally, pull requests should be assigned to team members who are subject matter experts. If you're not sure who to assign the PR too, you might want to ask in the #docs channel.

## Governance driven by practice area and working groups.

We encourage each team at Bloom to take ownership over their respective documentation. To that end, changes to files in certain directories require at least one review and approval from a member of the respective team, and members of those teams will be notified of that PR. For example, changes to the [060-engineering](../060-engineering) directory requires at least one review and approval from a member of the Engineering Team.

Ideally, each of the above working groups have their own backlog of documentation tasks, and make documentation a regular part of their workflow.
