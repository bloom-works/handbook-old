# Bloom Documents and Templates

When in doubt, you can always refer back to the [Bloom Full Team google shared drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0AOJVzBlrgkPcUk9PVA).

That is where we keep: 

* [Case studies](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TLBBLS_gLHOwbdY6HmFEAmhaW9AS-asI?usp=sharing): generally these are all in a 'draft' state, if you want to read the final versions you can refer to our website [here](https://bloomworks.digital/work)
* [Marketing and communication info](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CpFv0REjol60RMnmlus3sub1U9QbLCsl?usp=sharing): for things like Bloom's visual style guide, writing guide, and sample proposal responses
* [Team](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ifDUZX6Tq3CBvV03-49yNVeSIFG3QC9S?usp=sharing): for team resumes and bios
* [Templates](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ba-TApkKF7hLt5K0PCqjVVwX9UJERQMD?usp=sharing): to grab a template for a proposal, slide deck, Google doc, etc. 
* [PM Templates](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1VFms5OSWVNVeCsoie3YjbU0wDl143g4s): for project scoping and other project management-related activities
