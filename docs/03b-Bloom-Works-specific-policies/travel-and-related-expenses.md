# Travel and related expenses

Depending on your role, you may be asked to travel for a Bloom project.

Here's how we manage travel related expenses and reimbursements:

## Scheduling Travel and Incurring Expenses
All travel and expenses should be pre-approved by Lauren or Emdash. You’ll book travel and other expenses on your personal credit card and will be reimbursed. (If you have an issue doing this, please reach out to Lauren or Emdash) Policies will differ on a project-by-project basis. But in general, you should plan to book your travel in coordination with others on the project.

### Train/Flights
Do your best to keep these costs low, within reason. We recognize we don’t always have much lead time to book travel, so plan to book as soon as possible in coordination with your project team.

Only standard / coach fare will be reimbursed - if you choose to flight first / business class you will be responsible for the difference in cost. 

Any special add-ons such as 'even more room,' 'priority seating,' purchases while in-flight (movies, snacks, etc), and similar non-mandatory purchases are not reimburseable. 

### Lodging
Aim to keep these costs in alignment with the federal guidelines for lodging per diems, making use of government rates when applicable. If you are working on a government project, chances are you can utilize government rates.

You can reach out to Sofia if you need help with booking. 

### Cabs/Transportation
Needs will vary on a project-by-project basis, but a general rule is to keep this below $50/day.

If you pay wish cash, REQUEST A RECEIPT. Most cabs will have a paper voucher available for written receipts. 

### Meals & Incidentals
Policies will differ between projects, so please check with Lauren and Emdash for guidance if you're not sure. 

Assuming meals are considered a reimbursable expense on the project, you must collect a detailed receipt at the end of the meal and please also write in the names of who attended the meal. It's _very_ important that we distinguish meal expenses that are attended by clients and/or where alcohol is consumed. Both of these instances effect how we account for, and are taxed on, these types of expenses. 

For all State of CT work, you will be given a per diem for meals and incidentals. The per diem is $45.75 for any days that involve travel to/from CT and $61.00 for any days spent entirely in CT. As a result, you do not need to submit receipts for meals. Instead, in Harvest you should submit an expense of $45.75 for each travel day and $61 for each full day in CT.
Tracking Expenses

### Logging your expenses

*You’ll need to log all expenses in Harvest with receipts attached*. Please track the expenses based on the date of the work travel — not when the expense was incurred (e.g., if you book a flight in May for a flight in June, you should list the date of the flight as the date of the expense instead of the date you booked the flight).

**Receipts are of the utmost importance, collect them all!**

*Pro Tip - download the Harvest mobile app to track your expenses while on-the-go*

In some cases you can provide a bank statement as a substitude for actual receipts. These exceptions are considered on a case-by-case basis by HR or Ops.
