# Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to clarify guidelines for employee conduct and to outline appropriate disciplinary steps.

Employment with Bloom Works is "at will," which means it is subject to termination by either Bloom Works or the employee at any time, for any reason. Nothing in this policy provides any contractual rights regarding employee discipline or counseling, nor should anything in this policy be read or construed as modifying or altering the employment-at-will relationship between Bloom Works and its employees.

## Responsibilities of Employees

It is the duty and the responsibility of every Bloom Works employee to be aware of and to abide by existing policies and work rules.

It is also the responsibility of employees to perform their duties to the best of their ability and to the standards set forth in their job descriptions or as otherwise established. Employees are encouraged to take advantage of all learning opportunities available and to request additional instruction when needed.

## Responsibilities of Supervisors, Managers and Directors

The immediate supervisor, manager or director should approach corrective measures in an objective manner.

If the employee's performance of assigned tasks is the issue, the supervisor, manager or director should confirm that proper instructions, appropriate orientation and adequate training have been given and that the employee is aware of job expectations. Both single incidents and patterns of poor performance should be of concern.

If misconduct is the issue, the supervisor, manager or director should take steps to ensure that the employee is aware of the company's policies and regulations regarding employee conduct.

If, in either case, appropriate instruction or information was not communicated, the supervisor, manager or director should immediately develop a plan for delivering such instruction or information and should review the content with the employee.

## Progressive Discipline Process

Bloom Works supports the use of progressive discipline to address issues such as poor work performance or misconduct to encourage employees to become more productive workers and to adapt their behavior to company standards and expectations. Generally, a supervisor gives a warning to an employee to explain behavior that the supervisor has found unacceptable. There are two types of warnings: verbal and written.

A verbal warning occurs when a supervisor verbally counsels an employee about an issue of concern. A written record of the discussion, noting the date, event and recommended action, is placed in the employee's personnel file for future reference.

A written warning is used for behavior or performance that a supervisor considers serious or when a verbal warning has not helped change unacceptable behavior or performance. The department head, in consultation with human resources (HR), may place the employee on a performance improvement plan (PIP) not to exceed 90 days. Within this time period, the employee must demonstrate a willingness and ability to meet and maintain the conduct and work requirements specified by the supervisor and the organization. The supervisor and employee should meet regularly to assess the progress of the PIP. If the employee has met the goals and expectations described in the PIP, the supervisor will document that he or she has successfully completed the PIP. If established goals are not met, dismissal may occur.

Bloom Works reserves the right to administer appropriate disciplinary action for all forms of disruptive or inappropriate behavior. Each situation will be dealt with on an individual basis.

## Employee Conduct That Can Result in Disciplinary Action

Bloom Works has established general guidelines to govern the conduct of its employees. No list of rules can include all instances of conduct that can result in discipline, and the list of examples below is not exhaustive. Furthermore, sound judgment and common sense should prevail.

Examples of employee conduct that would lead to discipline and the usual course of disciplinary action have been separated into groups according to the usual severity and impact of the infraction. Violations may be handled differently depending on the group they are in and the specific circumstances. Bloom Works reserves the right to determine the appropriate level of discipline for any performance or conduct issues, including oral and written warnings, suspension with or without pay, demotion, and discharge.
