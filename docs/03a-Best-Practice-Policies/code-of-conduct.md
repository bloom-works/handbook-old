# Code of conduct

## General guidelines

In order to be successful together as a Bloom team, we strive to be respectful and open with each another. We want to create and maintain a community of trust,  which requires straight-forward, non-critical dialogue. There's little we can't resolve together with honest appraisal and an attitude of cooperation. We don't compete here, and we try really hard to keep communication constructive and open.

If an issue is in the category of harassment, [please refer to our policies on harassment and discrimination](../040-employee-handbook-us/anti-harassment-policies.md).

## Code of conduct

Within a virtual working environment, communication is vital to keeping a collaborative, healthy, and fun atmosphere. We want to foster an open, inclusive, and diverse culture with the freedom to be ourselves. With that in mind, we also want to ensure that everyone here is treated fairly and feels safe and welcome. We have a variety of communication tools and forums, including Slack, Zoom, and in-person events, and our code of conduct is intended for all of them.

### Guiding principles

- **Be mindful.** Having a diverse team means that we will have different opinions, viewpoints, and experiences. This also means that we may not agree on what is humorous, insulting, or rude. We all stand to learn from each other and that includes gaining awareness of how others perceive certain communications. 

- We follow **the platinum rule**. While the golden rule is to do to others as you would have them do to you, the platinum rule is to do to others as _they would like to have done to them_. This requires mindful attention of each person and respect for their culture, background, and vulnerabilities. We encourage everyone here to ask and listen for what other people want, from their perspective. This applies to all discussions in all communication mediums - including Slack, email, video calls, and in person.

- If you receive **feedback** that something you said or shared isn't respectful of another person, consider how to respond or if there's any action you need to take to maintain a respectful relationship. This can be challenging, and in some cases you may need to reach out to others to ask for feedback or guidance on how to behave in a respectful manner.

- Be open to **building relationships** across the team. As our team grows, we're more likely to have peers that we don't work with directly. Bloom creates opportunities for team members to get to know each other, including virtual coffee chats, regular staff meetings, and social Slack channels. When we can all participate in an authentic and active way, we contribute to the health and longevity of the company.

- **Be considerate and respectful**. We all have a voice and some of us happen to be louder than others. Think before you speak, and give others a chance to be heard. When you disagree with. colleague, focus on resolving issues constructively and ask for help if you need to. When meeting in person, be mindful of other people's boundaries and feel free to express your own physical boundaries. For example, some of us are huggers and some of us aren't â€” and the only way to know who's who is to ask.
