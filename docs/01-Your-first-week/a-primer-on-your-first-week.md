Welcome to your first week as a part of the Bloom Works team! We're delighted to get you started, this section will help you out with the absolute basics. 

You should have already received an email with your Bloom Works email login info and a link to your Bloom Works Onboarding Guide. The Onboarding Guide gives you a breakdown of the projects you'll be assigned to, introductions to important project team members, and links to any background or resource documents you may need to get you started. 
Your Guide will [look something like this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_ABDombDPjmqcTGfUpwCKNzG-lbwtRR2I9zjrrepdEI/edit#heading=h.wnpq93b1nawv) and if you can't find the link to your personalized Guide, they'll always be [in this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eQ-BROfVWOdE5juL84pXfofm0skB5x2n).
If on the off chance you're having any issues logging into your email or accessing your Onboarding Guide, you can Slack or [email Sofia](mailto:sofia@bloomworks.digital). 

When you log into your email for the first time you should see invitations to the following: 
- Slack
- Zoom
- Trello, [make sure to fill in your intro card during your first week](https://trello.com/invite/b/WVHYQUIn/bbae81f3206a92251f1a59ceaa62bad2/bloom-overview)
- Bloom Shared Calendar
- Harvest

Depending on your position at Bloom you may also receive invitations to: 
- Airtable
- GitHub
- Asana

On Slack, make sure you're following these important channels: 
- Bloom-bloomers
- Bloom-general
- Social-water-cooler
- Social-culture-and-values

There are many more Slack channels, check out the relevant section in this handbook for a description of our active channels. 

We also ask that during your first week you create a Bloom bio, resume, and submit a headshot for us. The next few handbook sections go into greater detail on those tasks.

As a rule we believe there are no stupid questions, so if you're not sure or something is unclear, don't hesitate to reach out and ask.
