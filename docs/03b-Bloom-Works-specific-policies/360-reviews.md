# 360 Reviews

Bloom Works prioritizes and encourages a healthy feedback culture - we believe that feedback doesn't need to be unkind in order to be impactful. 

During the Summer of 2021 we started to use a new process for giving and receiving feedback in 360 reviews. Overall the team gave great reviews and had a positive experience, but we're always open to new ideas / suggestions / feedback as we continue to host and facilitate these retrospectives. 

HR is in charge of scheduling the reviews on behalf of each staff member. The next round of retrospectives will happen in **March 2022. **

You can find the instructions and process overview [here in google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H_me8fdIlzEiwsbVH0xrOMNetAUMeXHwvRwmnQNrE9c/edit?usp=sharing)
