# Leaving Bloom Works

## At-will employment

All employment with Bloom Works is "at will." The relationship can be terminated by the employee or by Bloom Works at any time, for any or no reason, and without notice. But being who we are, we typically work together for a smooth transition.

## Resignation

Employees are asked to provide a minimum of 2 weeks written notice of their intent to resign (if possible). The notice should be submitted to the employee's manager or to someone on the management team. We may ask you for an exit interview.

## Termination

If Bloom Works sees a problem with an employee's performance, or there is otherwise clearly a bad fit between the employee and Bloom Works, we'll make every effort to remedy the issue(s). If termination turns out to be the only solution, the employee will be fully aware of, and probably in agreement with, the reasons.

## Return of company property

Any company property issued to employees, such as documents, computer equipment, or company credit cards, must be returned to Bloom Works at the time of separation.
