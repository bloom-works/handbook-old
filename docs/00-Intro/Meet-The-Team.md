## We have an awesome team — which now includes you!

When you join, you’ll be paired with **Lauren or Emdash** as your central point of contact at Bloom. You'll have regular check-ins (frequency and format to be determined with them) to make sure you’re getting everything you need to set you up for success.

## Meet fellow Bloomers!

Bloom is rich with rad team members that you may work with on a current or future project. To get a sense of who's on the team, [check out our bios on this Trello board](https://trello.com/b/WVHYQUIn/bloom-overview). When you get settled in, we encourage grabbing virtual coffee/tea/work-friendly beverage of your choice to learn more about us all and what we're working on.
