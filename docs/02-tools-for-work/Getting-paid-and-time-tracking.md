# Getting paid

## Employees
We use a service called Gusto to process our payroll. Pay days are twice per month (the 15th and month end). You’ll be asked to add your information (including bank information) into Gusto. You can also manage benefits in this space (more on that later). 

For any travel expenses you incur and log in Harvest, you’ll be reimbursed during the first pay period of the following month. More on travel and expenses below. 

## Independent contractors
On the last workday of each month, please submit your invoice to admin@bloomworks.digital. Any format works for us as long as it includes the total hours worked that month and all travel-related expenses that tie out exactly to the expenses and hours logged in Harvest.  Bloom works on a Net-30 basis (i.e., you will get paid 30 days after an invoice is submitted).

# Tracking your time

## Salaried employees
All salaried employees are expected to work 40 hours per week (85-95% billable) unless you have another arrangement with Bloom. Therefore, between 34-38+ hours should be billable if you are full time on a project. You must update your hours worked each day in Harvest (and in T Sheets for CT/Skylight team only). For more information on how to account for hours in Harvest, [check out this trello card](https://trello.com/c/MDeCS2Sd). 

Beginning in October 2021, we established a Google Doc called ["All Team Project and Staffing Board"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yJaEBIPDkfvggN2DkEXIKbfeRR9rOOmAnXtfOWyOtGM/edit#gid=222779496) where the PM's will project each team members' time allocations. Each Monday HR will input these allocations into your Harvest timesheet. It is your responsibility as an employee to go back to Harvest at the end of each week and update / adjust your timesheets to accurately reflect your actual-time-spent. HR sends a weekly reminder to make these adjustments, but try to get in the habit of doing it without relying on reminders! 

For any weeks where you work fewer than 40 hours, you'll need to log paid time off (PTO), holiday, or sick time in Harvest (project is Bloom > Holiday/PTO/sick) and also formally request the time in Gusto. [See this trello card](https://trello.com/c/bOtixcay) for more information on PTO, holiday, and sick policies.

For a general FAQ on time tracking here at Bloom, you can [refer to this Google Doc from September 2021](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZKem214TahVwl2K2OD5FNtP0_xX05nPdJ9CdAmShWwk/edit).

*Note: On the last workday of each month, please make sure all of your hours are up to date. For the CT/Skylight team, check to be sure that the hours you have logged in T Sheets match the CT/Skylight hours you’ve logged in Harvest.* 

## Independent contractors
All contractors must update hours worked each day in Harvest. The number of hours you expect to work each week should be determined with your Bloom point person (Lauren or Emily) at the time of hire. Some fluctuations between weeks are to be expected, and if you find yourself needing to work meaningfully less or more than initially discussed, please flag this for your point person (Lauren or Emily).  

*Note: On the last workday of each month, please make sure all of your hours are up to date, and send an invoice to admin@bloomworks.digital*
