# Expenses and reimbursement procedures

## General procedures

### Documentation
Bloom complies with IRS regulations for accountable plans which require that all business expenses be substantiated with adequate records. Documentation must include:

1. The amount of the expenditure
2. The date and place of the expenditure
3. The business purpose of the expenditure
4. The names of individuals other than yourself for whom the expenditures were made

### Itemized Receipts
Itemized receipts are required for all expenditures over $50 (or equivalent in foreign currency) with the exception of mileage reimbursement and gratuities. 

If no receipt exists or if the receipt is lost and cannot be reproduced, the employee may submit a copy of the credit card statement with the appropriate charge highlighted. _This does not guarantee your expense will be reimbursed._ In exceptional circumstances, credit card statements will be accepted as backup.

### Expense reporting and reimbursement
Expense reports should be submitted with proper receipts via Harvest within a reasonable time after the expense is incurred, general within 30 days of business travel. Please allow four weeks for processing. 

## Travel related expenses

### Air travel / train travel
Air travel for business purposes must be pre-approved by Lauren or Emdash. Economy/coach class will be suitable for all travel less than 5 hours. Individual flights of 5 hours and longer (not including layovers) may be upgraded only with manager and budget approval. When available, Premium Economy is acceptable if upcharge is reasonable (this will be at the discretion of the manager and determined by budget constraints). Employees may retain frequent flyer program benefits; however, participation in these programs should not influence flight selection. Employees should prioritize low cost airfare when selecting a flight. If the lowest-cost fare is unusually inconvenient, employees should raise these situations and have an alternative plan approved by their manager. Employees must use electronic tickets whenever possible, to prevent loss of travel information. Any exceptions to the above (i.e. business class travel for flights less than 5 hours) must be approved by a manager.

### Hotel lodging
Please take into account location, cost, and comfort when booking a hotel. Room types should be consistent with a standard room rate for the destination and of Marriott/Starwood or Hilton quality. Employees attending multi-day meetings or conferences may use reasonable lodging recommendations / reservations provided by event organizers to facilitate productive meetings and efficient transportation. Bloom Works will not reimburse incidental charges such as hotel movies and video games, toiletries or non-meal alcohol mini-bar charges. Reimbursement for hotel fitness center fees and WiFi is permitted if needed. Employees are responsible for cancelling lodging (when necessary) to avoid cancellation/no show fees.

### Ground transportation
Employees should select the most cost-effective mode of ground transportation that best suits the business purpose.  
   Needs will vary on a project-by-project basis, but a general rule is to keep the total cost below $50/day.  
   If you pay with cash, _request a receipt_. Most cabs will have a paper voucher available for written receipts. 
   
#### Parking / Tolls / Fines
Parking costs incurred during outside business meetings and tolls paid during travel will be reimbursed. The employee assumes the responsibility for all parking and traffic fines.

#### Personal vehicle usage
Mileage will be reimbursed at the IRS rate; miles driven during a work commute are excluded.

### Meals while traveling
Each employee is expected to find reasonably priced dining alternatives. As a general rule, employees are expected to spend $100.00 or less per day _inclusive of tax and gratuity_. Day trip meals are usually not reimbursable if within 50 miles of the employee work location (aka. home). 

**Note:** This section covers employee travel meals only; refer to the section titled 'Business Meals & Entertainment' for policy on meals/entertainment with business partners, consultants, recruits or vendors.

## Business meals and entertainment

### Business meals
For business meals, a detailed receipt is required which lists all attendees and the business topic.

### Employee meals, offsite or as part of group travel 
For employee meals outside of the work location (in most cases, "home") there should be a preset budget set by the project manager. Meals and beverage expenses incurred while entertaining customers/vendors are not included in the personal meal allowance, and are considered a business meal. For employee meals, you may spend no more than $50 per person, inclusive of gratuity and tax. 
   In most cases there should be 2 or more people in attendance for the meal, with a clear business purpose, to be considered reimburseable.
   
## Examples of non-reimbursable expenses
+ Airline membership fees/dues or upgrades
+ Annual dues on personal credit cards
+ Cancellation fees or expenses incurred for a personal trip which was cancelled, unless cancelled for a business emergency.
+ Cell phone equipment not provided by the Company
+ Credit card rewards plans, loyalty member programs or membership fees
+ Dependent Care including child care/babysitting
+ Expenses related to vacation or personal days while on a business trip
+ Flight upgrades such as business class, movie or snack purchases (not included in ticket price), and other similar non-mandatory expenses
+ Hotel no-show/cancellation charges â€“ except when business needs necessitate
+ Late payment and delinquency charges on credit cards
+ Personal entertainment
+ Hotel room movies / video games

## Logging the expense in Harvest 

### Process
Once you have estimated the total cost of the expense(s), message the budget owner to request approval. In most cases, the budget owner will be the project lead. Be sure to include any necessary details, including why the expense is necessary or recommended.  
 
 Once you've made the pre-approved purchase, log on to **Harvest > Expenses** and fill in the following fields:
 
 - **Date**: Use the date reflected on the receipt.

 - **Project**: If it's a client project, be sure to select that here and mark as unbillable. Bloom has a separate category for professional development-related expenses, which you can read about in the [professional development section of this handbook](https://bloom-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/03-policies/prodev/). 
 
 - **Category**: Select the best fit from the dropdown.


 - **Receipt**: Include the actual paper receipt AND an image showing the budget owner's approval of the expense.
 
 *Pro Tip - dowload the Harvest app to track your expenses while on-the-go* 
 
 If you don't see your project code or an appropriate category code, contact HR. 

### A special note about our CT project(s)
For all State of CT work, you will be given a per diem for meals and incidentals. The per diem is $45.75 for any days that involve travel to/from CT and $61.00 for any days spent entirely in CT. As a result, you do not need to submit receipts for meals. Instead, in Harvest you should submit an expense of $45.75 for each travel day and $61 for each full day in CT.
