# Password security

Passwords are the front line of protection for user accounts and an important aspect of computer security. To avoid compromising your work information — and possibly Bloom Works' entire corporate network — use the guidelines below to select and secure your passwords. All Bloom Works employees (including contractors and vendors with access to BW systems) are responsible for taking these steps.

### Password recommendations 

- Avoid repeating passwords for multiple websites.
- Passwords should be at least 8-15 characters in length. The longer, the better. 
- Use a mix of digits and punctuation characters (e.g., 0-9 and !@#$%^&*).
- Avoid using common words or phrases (e.g., "password" or "hello").
- **NEVER** base your password on personal information, names of family members, etc. 
  

Don't share your passwords with anyone. If you need to make an exception, be sure to reset your password ASAP. 

Treat your passwords as sensitive, confidential information. If someone requests your password(s), please let them know that you can't provide that information per Bloom Works policy. If you suspect an account or password has been compromised, report the incident immediately to Sofia and change all related passwords.

We recommend the use of a password manager program to help ensure that all passwords are strong, unique, and easy to change. 

Don't write down your passwords or store them on your web browser. Try to create passwords that can be easily remembered. One way to do this is to create a password based on a song title, affirmation, or other phrase. For example, the phrase might be "This may be one way to remember," and the password could be "TmB1w2R!" or "Tmb1W>r~" or some other variation.

### 2 factor authorization (2FA)

If you're given the option to opt into 2FA, please do so. 

# Phishing and email best practices

Hackers use fraudulent practices to spoof people into giving up their data. The most common technique is email phishing. Hackers send messages that appear legitimate or look like they're from someone you trust so that you engage with the message or click on malicious attachments.

If something seems fishy...it's probably phishing. Here are some tips to keep in mind to avoid falling victim so that we protect our company and its data:

### DO NOT: 
_DO NOT_ click a link or download from someone you don't know, or weren't expecting

+ Be especially careful if the email is marked ‘urgent,’ this is a distraction tactic

_DO NOT_ reply to a suspicious email or message from an email you don't recognize

+ If you’re not sure if it’s legit, ask a peer on the same project or another Bloom team member

_DO NOT_ ever send personal/sensitive information via email—e.g., passwords, credit card number, social security number, or account number

+ Check the address bar (i.e. URL) to see if the site matches the one you think you’re entering a password for. Use auto-fill from password managers (like 1Password or LastPass), which will check to see if the password matches the site it was created for.

### DO
_DO_ Double-check that the sender's email address matches who they claim to be

+ If it’s a Bloom employee or contractor reaching out using a non-Bloom email, VERIFY on Slack or phone (i.e. another trusted medium) that  it is correct before responding

+ Sometimes the sender and reply-to addresses are different, so check both at the time of receipt and the time of reply

_DO_ check for misspellings, grammatical errors, and abnormal spacing that may be indicative of a phishing email.

_DO_ check links by using your mouse to hover over the hyperlink to determine if the URL makes sense with the sender—e.g., matching the sender name to the URL; whether there's a foreign name or location in the URL
+ Avoid ‘pharming’ by checking the address in your browser's address bar after you arrive at a website to make sure it matches the address you typed, as it is possible to hijack and redirect a URL. Scammers keep watch for expiring domains and take them over, squatting and using the previous site owner's credentials to trick people into giving up their data.

_DO_ use common sense—if it doesn't look right, trust your judgment

### RED FLAGS
+ Does the email ask for any sensitive/personal information (password, credit cards, SSN, etc.)?
+ Does the email ask for sensitive information about others?
+ Does the email ask you to immediately act or open an attachment to avoid account closure?
+ Does the hover-text link match what's in the text?
+ Does the address in the ‘To’ field match the sender of the email?
