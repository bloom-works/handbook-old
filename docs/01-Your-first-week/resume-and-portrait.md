# Bloom Works resume and portrait instructions

Now that you're part of the team, we want to add you to the Bloom website!

## How to get your photo on the Bloom Works "Team" page:

* [Check out the photos on our website](https://bloomworks.digital/team) to get a general feel for what we’re serving up already.
* If you have an image that's similar in composition and vibe, [email it to Adam](mailto:adam@bloomworks.digital) or send it to him via Slack. 
* If you need to take a new photo:
 * find a spot with generous natural light — preferably outside, weather permitting
 * if you can manage to capture green foilage in the background, that'll match most of the current photos — but it's not required
 * if you're able, position the camera so there is generous space around you in the frame — ideally full body or waist up at least. The more space around you, the more we have to resize and crop to match existing photos
 * for reference, our team retreat photos were taken with an iPhone 12 Pro in Portrait Mode, around noon on a mostly clear day

If you have questions, reach out to Adam on Slack or on email.
 
## Bloom resume instructions

We often submit team members' resumes in our proposals, so we have a Bloom template for consistency. 

1. [Check out the resume template on GDrive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IS46KYx0JhVQKmTGxg8M_wS6nJSkADg35j3DynwWw5Y/edit?usp=sharing)
2. Create a copy and move it to the [Bloom Full Team Drive > Team > Bios, photos, resumes folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1wqWI38uNF0l8XbqhPGGLFDN-m26A4s60).
3. Once you've finished editing, share it with HR. They will follow up with you about any questions or clarifications. 

## Bloom mini Bios

1. [Add a row to this Google Doc of mini bios](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZwTnx2pAUeh73eHuyBeCUjQB3d7Yf_X-r5_We-0iQps/edit)
2. Add your photo, name (with a link to your LinkedIn profile if you want it shared on our website), and 2-3 bullets of info about your professional experience. 
 
Aaaaand that’s it. Just a few simple steps and you too can be a staple of the Bloom Works Team Page! Huzzah and hooray!
