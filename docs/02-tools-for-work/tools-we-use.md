# Equipment and tools we use

Here's more about the equipment and tools you will be using with us to GSD. 

## Computer/hardware
Bloom is a bring-your-own-device workplace. You're responsible for getting the equipment that will help you complete your work and participate fully in our remote work environment (e.g., you'll need a web cam). 

We work hard to make sure the collaboration tools we use are compatible with all devices so that you can keep working with whatever system suits you best.

*Note: [We provide a tech stipend for all salaried Bloom folks](https://bloom-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/03-policies/benefits/).*

## Email
When you join Bloom (yay), you’ll be issued a google-based @bloomworks.digital email address. Besides being a useful communication tool, it’ll also serve as **your entry point to all the other tools**. 

This will be the main address you use to more formally communicate with our partners on projects. 

### Setting up your email signature
[Please use this email template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RaK-lQacImYNa-fyfDrY5iIvU5X7gSm1bq0ilfa1tBI/edit?usp=sharing). If you have any questions, Slack HR or Ops. 


## Trello
We use Trello to collaborate on tasks for our various projects. Each project has a separate board which we'll give you access to when you join. Each team will use Trello a bit differently, so please defer to your project lead for any team norms on how to use the project board. 

For generic information on using Trello, [see Trello's getting started guide](https://trello.com/en-US/guide/trello-101).

If you need to be invited to our organization, HR or Ops for help. 

## Zoom
You can use whatever video conferencing tool is easiest for team-related calls, but we generally use Zoom for more formal calls with partners. Sometimes you will need to adjust to what a partner uses (e.g., Microsoft Teams).

In general, team members will receive free account access, so your meeting times will be limited to 40 minutes. If you think your meeting will need to run longer, contact HR or Ops so that they can arrange a meeting from a paid account. 

## Mural
We use this whiteboarding tool mainly during the discovery phases of our work, but we occasionally use it as a facilitation tool for meetings. 
We have a [shared Bloom account](https://app.mural.co/t/bloom5049) with limited licenses. If you need facilitator access, reach out to HR or Ops. 

## Gusto (salaried employees only)
This is the system we use to process payroll, and where you’ll request paid time off and sick leave. More on that in [the section on getting paid and time tracking](https://bloom-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/02-tools-for-work/Getting-paid-and-time-tracking/). 

## Harvest (for both employees and contractors)
This is the platform we use for expenses and time tracking. In order for Bloom to stay in compliance with contracting requirements, **you must log your hours on a daily basis**. Please make sure to add this to your regular daily workflow. 

This is also where you will log any expenses you incur for work travel. For more details on billing categories and invoices, [please see our Trello card on how billing works](https://trello.com/c/MDeCS2Sd). 

## T Sheets (for CT/Skylight work only)
This is the platform our partners at Skylight use for time tracking. Each day, you’ll need to log the hours you worked related to any State of CT projects.
Skylight will send you an invitation to the platform separately. If you don't see it on your first day, contact HR. 

*Note: For any questions about access to these tools — or to suggest other tools — please contact HR.*
