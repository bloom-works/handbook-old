# Equipment and tools we use

Here's more about the equipment and tools you will be using with us to GSD. 

## Computer/hardware
Bloom is a bring-your-own-device workplace — we each bring the equipment of our choice to enable work and particularly remote work (e.g. web cams). 
We work hard to make sure the collaboration tools we use are compatible with all devices so that you can keep working with whatever system suits you best.

*Note: [We provide a tech stipend for all salaried Bloom folks](https://bloom-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/03-policies/benefits/).*

## Email
When you join Bloom (yay), you’ll be issued a google-based @bloomworks.digital email address. Besides being a useful communication tool, it’ll also serve as **your entry point to all the other tools**. 

This will be the main address you use to more formally communicate with our partners on projects. 

### Setting up your email signature
[Please use this email template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RaK-lQacImYNa-fyfDrY5iIvU5X7gSm1bq0ilfa1tBI/edit?usp=sharing). If you have any questions, Slack Sofia. 

## Slack
Our central slack workspace is govbloomdigital.slack.com which you can [access by signing up for Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/govbloomdigital/signup). For an introduction to using Slack, [check out Slack's guide to getting started](https://slack.com/help/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-members).

Please keep in mind that some Slack channels and workspaces may include our partners/clients. 

For some projects, we may join teams on separate workspaces. We’ll grant you access to those on a project-by-project basis.    

Here's a quick intro to our internal channels:

- **Bloomers** — Where we post new HR policies, etc. 

- **Familiars** - For sharing cute pictures and stories of our favorite people (kids, partners, pets, you name it)

- **General** - For company-wide announcements and work matters

- **Good Reads** - For sharing relevant articles, events, and other pieces of interest

- **Hiring** – A space to share hiring ideas and discuss logistics (*NOT* to be used to discuss individual candidates)

- **Random** - When you're not sure where to share it

- **Water Cooler** - Our equivalent for the company breakroom 

- **BD General** - Business development team discussion space, especially for proposals

- **BD Opportunities** - Sharing RFX's of interest

- **Bloom Comms** - Updates on what Bloom is promoting, which may include [Pollinator](https://medium.com/pollinator) posts and other news that we'll ask you to share with your networks

- **Bloom Website** - For BW website updates

- **Data Viz** - For all things data visualization related

- **Lurkers** - Some folks like to be in our Slack but aren't employees (maybe they will be one day or maybe they were in the past)

- **Tech** - Github help, security policy questions, anything tech related

## Trello
We use Trello to collaborate on tasks for our various projects. Each project has a separate board which we'll give you access to when you join. Each team will use Trello a bit differently, so please defer to your project lead for any team norms on how to use the project board. 
For generic information on using Trello, [see Trello'sgetting started guide](https://trello.com/en-US/guide/trello-101).
If you need to be invited to our organization, ask JJ or Sofia for help. 

## Zoom
You can use whatever video conferencing tool is easiest for team-related calls, but we generally use Zoom for more formal calls with partners. Sometimes you will need to adjust to what a partner uses (e.g., Microsoft Teams).
In general, team members will receive free account access, so your meeting times will be limited to 40 minutes. If you think your meeting will need to run longer, contact Sofia so that she can arrange a meeting from a paid account. 

## Mural
We use this whiteboarding tool mainly during the discovery phases of our work, but we occasionally use it as a facilitation tool for meetings. 
We have a [shared Bloom account](https://app.mural.co/t/bloom5049) with limited licenses. If you need facilitator access, reach out to Sofia. 

## Gusto (salaried employees only)
This is the system we use to process payroll, and where you’ll request paid time off and sick leave. More on that in [the section on getting paid and time tracking](https://bloom-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/02-tools-for-work/Getting-paid-and-time-tracking/). 

## Harvest (for both employees and contractors)
This is the platform we use for expenses and time tracking. In order for Bloom to stay in compliance with contracting requirements, **you must log your hours on a daily basis**. Please make sure to add this to your regular daily workflow. 
This is also where you will log any expenses you incur for work travel. Please see the [How Billing Works Trello card](https://trello.com/c/MDeCS2Sd) for more details on billing categories and invoices. 

## T Sheets (for State of CT work only)
This is the platform our partners at Skylight use for time tracking. Each day, you’ll need to log the hours you worked related to any State of CT projects.
Skylight will send you an invitation to the platform separately. If you don't see it on your first day, contact Sofia. 

*Note: For any questions about access to these tools - or to suggest other tools - please contact Sofia.*
