## Shared Calendars
Right now we're keeping things pretty simple:

* **Bloom-Calendar** is where we document team member's Out of Office / vacation time, operations deadlines of importance, and general info that needs to be shared with the whole team
* **Bloom-BD** is where we track proposal timelines, BD-related events, etc. 

### Setting up your Google calendar for the first time

Whether you're a maker mind or manager mind [you'll hear this article referenced from time to time](https://medium.com/coaching-notes/maker-mind-vs-manager-mind-f4e01d294d34) - your team members rely on your calendar remaining accurate and up-to-date.

On your personal Bloom calendar, go into the settings by clicking the gear icon in the upper right hand corner. 

Here are a few settings we recommend updating:

- select your default guest permissions, we suggest that you allow guests to 'modify event'
- set your notification settings for events
- confirm your working hours 

### About working hours and location in your calendar settings

This is a useful way of establishing some boundaries in your work - by setting office hours you give everyone at Bloom a view of your expected hours in the office. For example: Sofia has her calendar set 8am - 4pm, since she is an early riser. 
It also sets your calendar to send Bloomers an automatic notification if they're trying to schedule you outside of office hours. 

Also, if you are traveling and will be in a different timezone than usual we recommend you enable the 'working location' function which will help inform your coworkers of your time change. 

### Some general tips we've learned based on shared experience:

We use the shared 'Bloom Calendar' to document our days out of the office. If you plan to be away from your desk / out of contact for 4+ hours then please make sure that you set an Out of Office event on the shared cal, *in addition to your personal cal*. 

If you prefer to have some 'heads down' work time, you can use your calendar to map out "cone of silence" time blocks. That way your team members will avoid booking you during those times / will inquire in advance if they need to schedule a meeting during that time. 

If you have a personal appointment, you can set the event visibility on your calendar to 'private.' (see screenshot) Life happens so if you know you need to take an hour to pick up your kid from day care, put it on your cal so we know not to bother you

Zoom is integrated into our calendars so video conference info will automatically populate into your events. If you will regularly be hosting meetings 40+ minutes long, please check with HR that you have a license.
